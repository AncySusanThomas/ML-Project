   * Regional Performance - Visualise sales performance across different regions using scatter plots.
.We have created the data models using algorithms such as:
  * Linear Regression Model
  * Random Forest Regression Model
  * Decision Tree Model.
Pls have a look up on it and feel free to share if there is any updation or suggestion on this project.
